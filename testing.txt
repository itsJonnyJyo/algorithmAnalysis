Each algorithm was tested for correct results using various values
for X, then compared with results of the same polynomial computed
using a calculator.


Final results appear to be correct. I initially believed the Term-by-Term
algorithm would run slower than Horner's rule due to more elementary
operations within the algorithm. The results of my program agree with
that assumption.
